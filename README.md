# ReWired 2024 Hackathon ReRemote Client

This is the frontend implementation to display the information that is transmitted by the
[Websocket Server](https://github.com/kKar1503/rewired-server-2024).

The frontend implementation aims to showcase what the ReRemote product provides at the basic level from
a proper usage of its devices using the information from the server.

This Next.JS TypeScript project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Product: ReRemote

The product ReRemote is a product aim to repurpose IR sensors from remote controllers to act as gates that would help track
the number of persons that pass by.

The product is design to provide the ability to keep track of the number of people in a specific area based on people moving
through the ReRemote's gates. With that, we would have the ability to downstream this information to control room
temperature, air conditioning, and lighting in an efficient manner. For instance, if nobody is present in an area, one might
turn off the power of certain appliances to save energy.

However, the possibility for such integration is endless, as the product only provides a simple, elegent and yet infinitely
extensible interface that allows for all types of integration that can utilise the number of people in different section of
the house.
